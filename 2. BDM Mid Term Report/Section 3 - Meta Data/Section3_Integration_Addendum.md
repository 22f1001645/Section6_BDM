# Section 3 — Integration Addendum (Unknown Category Callout)

- Confidence statement alignment:
  - "Category mapping confidence is 97%; the remaining ~3% medium-confidence SKUs are primarily in the `UNKNOWN` tier and undergo adaptive retraining and consensus enrichment in Section 5 (see subsection 5.8: Unknown Category Reclassification)."

- Cross-linking guidance:
  - Point evaluators to `UNKNOWN_AUDIT.csv` for cohort sizing and confidence distribution.
  - Note that remediation targets are documented in Section 5.8 (reduce Unknown to <5%, confidence ≥95%).
