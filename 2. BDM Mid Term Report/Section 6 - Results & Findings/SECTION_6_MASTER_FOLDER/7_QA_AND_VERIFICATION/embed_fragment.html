        <h3>O — Observation</h3>
        <p>Across the portfolio, <span class="metric">746</span> SKUs exhibit coefficient of variation (CV) above 25%, indicating substantial demand volatility. The worst ten SKUs show CVs ranging from 116.7% up to 238.6%, which materially impacts forecasting and stocking accuracy.</p>
        <h3>R — Rationale</h3>
        <p>High CV typically reflects seasonality, promotion windows, and product mix transitions. In produce, supply-side variability interacts with demand spikes, creating asymmetric risk where stockouts and overstock can co-exist within weeks.</p>
        <h3>I — Implication</h3>
        <p>Volatility above 25% correlates with increased stockout risk and carrying costs. Targeted smoothing via safety stock rules and promotion governance can mitigate loss of sales while avoiding inventory write-down.</p>
        <h3>R — Recommendation</h3>
        <p>Prioritize volatility dampening for the top decile SKUs using weekly replinishment cadence, demand shaping (bundles), and substitution pathways for highly erratic items.</p>
