┌─ OBSERVATION (The FACT) ─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ What does the data show?                                      │
│ Be specific. Include numbers. Use superlatives (highest,      │
│ lowest, fastest, slowest). Never vague.                       │
│ Example: "770 SKUs (88%) show CV > 25%, top 10 exhibit CV    │
│ 85-142%, only 15 SKUs maintain CV < 10%"                     │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                              ↓
┌─ REASON (The ROOT CAUSE) ────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Why did this happen? What operational factors explain it?    │
│ Link to business context: seasonality, customer behavior,    │
│ competitive dynamics, internal policy.                        │
│ Example: "Volatility driven by (1) seasonal patterns—        │
│ beverages peak Apr-Jun monsoon prep; (2) festival cycles—   │
│ sales spike pre-Diwali; (3) product mix—staples stable,     │
│ specialty items erratic"                                     │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─ IMPLICATION (The BUSINESS CONSEQUENCE) ─────────────────────┐
│ What's at stake? Quantify the impact financially.            │
│ Link to profitability, cash flow, operational efficiency.    │
│ Example: "₹240k lost sales from stockouts + ₹176k overstock  │
│ carrying cost + ₹X working capital inefficiency = ₹Y total  │
│ business impact"                                             │

## SECTION 6 WRITING SEQUENCE

### **Step 1: Opening Paragraph (Boilerplate)**

```
Section 6 presents key analytical findings derived from the six methods described in 
Section 5. Using primary data from Pure'O Naturals 0007-Anjaneya Nager spanning April-
September 2025 (N=183 days, M=13 columns), six major findings emerge addressing revenue 
volatility, profitability pressure, inventory misalignment, and pricing consistency. Each 
finding follows the ORIR framework—Observation, Reason, Implication, Recommendation—
providing quantified evidence and actionable business recommendations tied to the four 
problem objectives. Collectively, these findings quantify ₹₹X in at-risk revenue, ₹Y in 
operational inefficiency, and ₹Z in improvement opportunity, enabling evidence-based 
strategic decision-making.
```

---

### **Step 2: For EACH Finding (6-8 times)**

**Repeat this block:**

```
## Finding N: [Title] ([Method Name])

**Figure 6.X.X — [Chart Type]: [Purpose]**
*Source: `source_file.csv`; [Description]*

TARGET METRICS
- Metric 1: Baseline → Target | Timeline
- Metric 2: Baseline → Target | Timeline
```

---

### **Step 3: Closing Paragraph**

```
These six findings collectively quantify Pure'O Naturals' operational challenges and 
quantify improvement opportunity: revenue volatility creates ₹X working capital strain, 
low-margin products erode ₹Y annual profit, slow-movers lock ₹Z in excess inventory, and 
pricing inconsistency leaks ₹W annually. Through systematic implementation of the tiered 
recommendations above—prioritized by timeline (immediate: Week 1-2, short-term: Week 2-4, 
strategic: Month 1-3, long-term: Month 3-6)—Pure'O Naturals can achieve concrete outcomes: 
stabilize revenue CV from 47% to <40%, eliminate negative-margin SKUs, reduce slow-mover 
inventory by 60%, and recover ₹512k annual revenue leakage. Total projected 12-month impact: 
₹[SUM] working capital release + ₹[SUM] profit improvement, enabling sustainable competitive 
positioning in the organized organic retail sector.
```

## ELITE SECTION 6 PHRASING EXAMPLES

### ✅ ELITE (Use This)

"Slow-mover analysis identifies 23 products (26% of portfolio) with DSLS >90 days, 
collectively holding ₹176.4k inventory generating <₹2.3k monthly revenue. Carrying cost 
for these 23 SKUs (₹44.1k annually) EXCEEDS their total annual revenue (₹27.6k), 
resulting in net ₹16.5k annual loss before spoilage adjustment."

### ❌ WEAK (Avoid This)

"Some products don't sell well and are costing the business money. We should get rid 
of them to save space and money."
