**MISSING 1: Figure 6.1.1 - High-Volatility Distribution**
```
Chart Type: Histogram (Distribution) + Value Distribution Table
Data Source: high_volatility_products.csv
Brainstorm Questions:
  1. Should we show ALL 770 SKUs or just highlight top 10 + bottom 15?
     → Recommendation: Show distribution shape (histogram) + highlight extremes (top 5, bottom 5)
  2. How to make 770 data points readable on one chart?
     → Recommendation: Bin into CV ranges (0-10%, 10-25%, 25-50%, 50-100%) → show count bars
  3. What insight should pop for reader?
     → Recommendation: "88% of products show CV >25% = high management complexity"

Design:
  - Left side: Histogram showing CV distribution (binned)
  - Right side: Value annotations (# of SKUs per bin)
  - Overlay: Mean CV 47% line, industry benchmark <30% dashed line
  - Color gradient: Red (high CV >50%), Yellow (moderate 25-50%), Green (low <25%)
```

**MISSING 2: Figure 6.1.2 - Rolling Volatility Seasonal Trend**
```
Chart Type: Line Chart (Time-series) with Peak Annotations
Data Source: rolling_volatility.csv
Brainstorm Questions:
  1. Should we show overall + by-category or just overall?
     → Recommendation: Show overall + overlay Beverages (most volatile category)
  2. How to highlight June peak vs baseline?
     → Recommendation: Use peak shading (light blue zone Jun 15-30) + value label "52%"
  3. What insight should pop?
     → Recommendation: "June volatility 62% above Jul baseline → requires 40% safety stock increase"

Design:
  - X-axis: Dates (Apr 1 - Sep 30)
  - Y-axis: Rolling σ (%)

```
Chart Type: Bar Chart (revenue by SKU) + Line Chart (cumulative %)
Data Source: abc_classification.csv
Brainstorm Questions:
  1. Show all 87 SKUs or summarize by class?
     → Recommendation: Show top 20 SKUs as bars (ranking), then aggregate "Others" for visibility
  2. How to mark class boundaries (68%, 82%)?
     → Recommendation: Vertical dashed lines at 68% and 82% cumulative %, label "Class A/B/C"
  3. What's the key insight?
     → Recommendation: "Top 12 SKUs (14% of portfolio) = 68% revenue; resource allocation urgency"

Design:
  - Left Y-axis: Individual SKU revenue (₹)

Design:
  - Bar chart: Top 15 slowest-moving products, horizontal bars
  - X-axis: DSLS (days), scale 0-150
  - Color gradient: Green <30d, Yellow 30-60d, Orange 60-120d, Red >120d
  - Value labels: Show DSLS, revenue, inventory value per SKU
  - Summary box: "23 SKUs DSLS >90d; Total carrying cost ₹44.1k; Annual revenue ₹27.6k"
  - Alert callout: "5 products DSLS >120d = potential spoilage risk"
```

**MISSING 6: Figure 6.4.1 - Price Misalignment Top 20**
```
Chart Type: Bar Chart (horizontal, sorted by CV)
Data Source: pricing_misalignment_top20.csv
Brainstorm Questions:
  1. What's the max CV observed? How to visualize unit price range?
     → Recommendation: Show CV % as bar length, add value label showing price range (₹min-₹max)
  2. Should we show revenue impact or just CV?
     → Recommendation: Show CV as bar + overlay bubble size = revenue impact (₹)
  3. What's the key insight?
     → Recommendation: "Top 20 SKUs CV 16.8% vs acceptable <5%; ₹512k annual revenue leakage"

Design:
  - Horizontal bar chart: Top 20 misaligned SKUs
  - X-axis: Unit price CV (%), scale 0-25% with acceptable threshold <5% marked
  - Bar color gradient: Green <5%, Yellow 5-10%, Orange 10-15%, Red >15%
  - Value labels: CV %, unit price range (₹min-₹max), revenue impact
  - Bubble overlay: Bubble size = total revenue per SKU
  - Summary box: "Average CV 16.8%; ₹2.05M revenue exposure; ₹512k annual leakage (50% downside error)"
```

## 🎨 PHASE 3: IDEATION FOR MISSING PIECES

### **STEP 3.1: Ideate Chart Generation Strategy**

For each missing visualization, recommend optimal approach:

**Option A: Python Visualization (Recommended)**
```
Tool: matplotlib + seaborn (available in ada_pipeline.py)
Advantage: Reproducible, publication-quality, exact control
Disadvantage: Requires Python execution
Timeline: 30-40 min per chart
Quality: High (professional, consistent styling)
```

**Option B: Excel/Google Sheets**
```
Tool: Built-in charts (if data exports available)
Advantage: Quick, accessible
Disadvantage: Limited customization, less professional
Timeline: 15-20 min per chart
Quality: Medium (basic charts, limited formatting)
```

**Option C: Tableau/Power BI (if available)**
```
Tool: Business intelligence platform
Advantage: Highly interactive, professional dashboards
Disadvantage: Requires software subscription
Timeline: 20-30 min per chart
Quality: Very high (enterprise-grade)
```

**TRAE IDE PRO Recommendation:**
Use **Python (matplotlib + seaborn)** for all 6 missing charts. Leverage existing ada_pipeline.py structure, add new visualization functions for each chart type, execute sequentially. Expected timeline: 3-4 hours total for all 6 charts.

---

### **STEP 3.2: Ideate Data Extraction & Preprocessing**

Before generating visualizations, TRAE IDE PRO should:

1. **Load all 12 CSV files** into pandas DataFrames
2. **Validate data integrity** (no NaN critical values, row counts match expectations)
3. **Extract key statistics** for each finding:
   - Finding 1: CV distribution (mean, median, std, top 10 values, bottom 5 values)
   - Finding 2: Rolling σ timeline (Apr baseline, Jun peak, Jul-Sep trough, category breakdown)
   - Finding 3: Margin distribution (mean, median, # <15%, # <0%, top 3 losses)
   - Finding 4: ABC distribution (Class A count & revenue, Class B, Class C; Pareto %)
   - Finding 5: DSLS distribution (# >90d, # >120d, total inventory value, carrying cost)
   - Finding 6: Price CV distribution (mean CV, top 20 range, revenue exposure estimate)

4. **Create summary statistics table** (CSV or markdown) for quick reference while writing ORIR sections

---

### **STEP 3.3: Ideate ORIR Text Extraction Strategy**

For each finding's ORIR text:

```
OBSERVATION (2-3 sentences with exact numbers)
└─ Source: Extracted statistics table
└─ Example: "Slow-mover analysis identifies 23 products (26% of portfolio) with DSLS >90 days,
            collectively holding ₹176.4k inventory generating <₹2.3k monthly revenue."
└─ Brainstorm: What's the single most striking number? Lead with that.

REASON (2-3 sentences explaining root cause)
└─ Source: EDA findings + Mastery Guide context
└─ Example: "Slow-mover accumulation stems from SKU introduction without demand forecasting,
            seasonal misalignment (post-season items retained year-round), and discontinued
            customer preferences (brand switching, category decline)."
└─ Brainstorm: Why does this make business sense? Connect to retail operations logic.

IMPLICATION (2-3 sentences with ₹ impact)
└─ Source: Carrying cost calculations, opportunity cost, risk quantification
└─ Example: "Annual carrying cost for 23 SKUs (₹44.1k) EXCEEDS their total annual revenue
            (₹27.6k), resulting in net ₹16.5k annual loss before spoilage adjustment."
└─ Brainstorm: What's the bottom-line consequence? How much money at stake?

RECOMMENDATION (3-4 sentences with phases, timelines, metrics)
└─ Source: Business logic + Mastery Guide action examples
└─ Example: "Phase 1 (Week 1-2): Tier 1 products (DSLS >120d, 5 SKUs) receive 30% discount
            or donation. Phase 2 (Week 2-4): Tier 2 (90-120d, 10 SKUs) receive 15% discount.
            Expected: Eliminate ₹44.1k carrying cost, free 240 linear feet shelf space."
└─ Brainstorm: What's the most actionable next step? What's the timeline? What's the payoff?
```
