**TASK 2.2: Section 6 Elite Elevation (The Critical Focus)**

```
ELITE SECTION 6 MASTERY (Mastery Guide Part 2.3F & Part 3):

FINDING 1: Revenue Volatility (CV Analysis)

OBSERVATION (Must be Laser-Sharp):
├─ Current: Check Section 6 HTML for Finding 1 Observation text
├─ Elite Requirement: "Daily revenue demonstrates significant fluctuation: overall 
│  branch CV = 47%, indicating that actual daily revenue typically deviates ±47% 
│  from mean daily revenue of ₹423,898. Product-level analysis reveals even greater 
│  heterogeneity: 746 SKUs (88% of portfolio) exhibit CV > 25%, signaling high 
│  demand variability. Top 10 most volatile SKUs show CV ranging from 85-142%, 
│  while only 15 SKUs maintain CV < 10% (stable demand items)."
├─ Check: Specific numbers ✓  Range visible ✓  Extremes called out ✓
└─ Status: Elite / Good / Needs Enhancement

REASON (Must Be Root-Cause Rigorous):
├─ Current: Check Section 6 HTML text
├─ Elite Requirement: Must explain WHY CV 47% (not just state fact)
│  Example: "Volatility concentration stems from three factors: (1) Seasonal 
│  demand patterns—beverages peak April-June (CV 52%) during heat season, decline 
│  July-September (CV 28%) monsoon (demonstrating 55% swing); (2) Festival-driven 
│  buying cycles—sales spike 2-3 weeks pre-Diwali, immediate post-festival crash; 
│  (3) Product category mix—staples (salt, basic spices, milk) show CV 8-15% 
│  (essential goods, consistent demand), while specialty items (imported snacks, 
│  premium brands) show CV 95-150% (discretionary, sporadic purchases)."
├─ Check: Root cause explained ✓  Business logic sound ✓  Specific examples ✓
└─ Status: Elite / Good / Needs Enhancement

IMPLICATION (Must Be ₹-Impact Quantified):
├─ Current: Check Section 6 HTML
├─ Elite Requirement: NEVER say "high volatility creates challenges"
│  INSTEAD say "High volatility creates three quantified challenges: (1) Working 
│  capital inefficiency—unpredictable ₹inflows complicate payables scheduling and 
│  credit facility planning, estimated opportunity cost ₹180k annually; (2) Inventory 
│  strain—uniform 10% safety stock inadequate for high-volatility items, resulting 
│  in simultaneous stockouts (estimated ₹240k lost sales from Top 10 volatile SKU 
│  stockouts over 6 months) and overstock (₹176k tied up in slow-mover inventory); 
│  (3) Supplier coordination—procurement lead times assume stable demand, fail under 
│  volatility, causing emergency orders cost premium ₹85k annually."
├─ Check: ₹ quantified ✓  Risk magnitude clear ✓  Specific impacts ✓
└─ Status: Elite / Good / Needs Enhancement

RECOMMENDATION (Must Be SMART + Phased):
├─ Current: Check Section 6 HTML
├─ Elite Requirement: NEVER recommend "improve volatility management"
│  INSTEAD provide: "Phase 1 (0-2 weeks): Implement quadrant-based safety stock 
│  policy. High-volatility High-volume (Beverages, Category X): 40% safety stock 
│  buffer, weekly reorders. High-volatility Low-volume (Specialty items, Category Y): 
│  50% safety stock OR discontinuation review. Low-volatility High-volume (Staples, 
│  Category Z): 10% safety stock, monthly reorders. Low-volatility Low-volume (Niche, 
│  Category W): 5% safety stock, as-needed ordering. [Continue Phase 2, 3...]"
│  Expected metrics: "Target: Reduce revenue CV from 47% to <40% (25% volatility 
│  reduction), achieve 98% fill rate (current ~92%), free up ₹88k working capital 
│  (50% of slow-mover inventory). Monitoring: Track weekly CV using rolling 30-day 
│  window via dashboard. Owner: Store Manager. Timeline: Weeks 1-2 immediate, 
│  Month 1 short-term, Month 3 long-term."
├─ Check: Phases clear ✓  Timelines specific ✓  Metrics attached ✓
└─ Status: Elite / Good / Needs Enhancement

├─ Pure'O Application: Class A 12 SKUs (14%) = 68% revenue; Class C 61 SKUs (70%) = 18%
├─ Mastery Signal: Does ABC classification drive inventory policy differentiation?
│  Example Elite: "Class A SKUs receive daily monitoring, reorder trigger at 7-day 
│  stock level. Class C SKUs reviewed quarterly, reorder trigger at 30-day stock 
│  level or discontinuation evaluation"
│  Example Weak: "Products are classified as A, B, C"
├─ Section 6 Status: Present? ✓/✗  Actionable? ✓/✗  Policy differentiated? ✓/✗

ELITE METRIC 3: Days Since Last Sale (DSLS) Aging

├─ Pure'O Application: 846 SKUs <15% margin; 95 SKUs negative margin; ₹2,242,359 margin at risk
├─ Mastery Signal: Does margin finding propose tiered pricing repair?
│  Example Elite: "Two-tier margin repair: (1) Immediate pricing (Salt ₹30→33, Spices 
│  ₹18→21, expected elasticity -0.3 to -0.4 → net revenue gain 6-10%); (2) Strategic 
│  bundling (low-margin staple + high-margin premium with 5% discount, target attach 
│  rate 12% → 25%)"
│  Example Weak: "Improve margins for low-margin products"
├─ Section 6 Status: Present? ✓/✗  Tiered repair proposed? ✓/✗  Pricing specific? ✓/✗
