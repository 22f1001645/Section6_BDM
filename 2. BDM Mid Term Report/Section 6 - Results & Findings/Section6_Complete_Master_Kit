---

### **Day 2: Write Findings 1-2 (Volatility Focus)**
**Effort:** 3 hours | **Output:** Finding 1 (Volatility) + Finding 2 (Seasonal), ~800 words

**Finding 1: Revenue Volatility (Coefficient of Variation Analysis)**
- Chart: Figure 6.1.1 (Distribution of CV across SKUs)
- ORIR structure:
  - O: 770 SKUs (88%) show CV >25%, top 10 show 85-142%
  - R: Seasonal demand (beverages), festival cycles, category mix
  - I: ₹240k lost sales from stockouts + ₹176k overstock
  - R: Quadrant safety stock policy (Q1: 40%, Q2: 10%, Q3: 5%, Q4: 50%)

**Finding 2: Rolling Volatility Seasonal Pattern**
- Chart: Figure 6.1.2 (Time-series rolling σ with peak annotations)
- ORIR structure:
  - O: June peak rolling σ 52% vs July 28% baseline
  - R: Monsoon prep, festival stocking, post-season lull
  - I: June requires ₹2.22M inventory, procurement lead time critical
  - R: Procurement calendar: Order by Apr 15 for Jun peak

**Writing Tips:**
- Use elite phrasing from kit
- Start with O (most factual), end with R (forward-looking)
- Every metric quantified
- Each section 3-4 sentences

---

- ORIR structure:
  - O: 42 SKUs (48%) <15% margin; 3 SKUs negative margin
  - R: Strategic positioning (staples compete on price), pricing uniformity
  - I: ₹12.3k annual loss from loss-makers, ₹3:1 capital efficiency gap
  - R: Price increases (Salt +10%, Spices +17%), discontinue losses, bundling

**Finding 4: ABC Classification Pareto Distribution**
- Chart: Figure 6.3.1 (Pareto chart: bar revenue + cumulative line %)
- ORIR structure:
  - O: Class A 12 SKUs (14%) = 68% revenue; Class C 61 SKUs (70%) = 18%
  - R: Seasonal bestsellers, customer staples, niche fragmentation
  - I: Shelf allocation mismatch (Class A 18% space for 68% revenue)
  - R: Reallocate: Class A 28%, Class B 25%, Class C 22%

**Finding 5: Slow-Movers & Wastage**
- Chart: Figure 6.3.2 (DSLS distribution bar + age alert heatmap)
- ORIR structure:
  - O: 23 SKUs (26%) DSLS >90 days; ₹176.4k inventory, ₹27.6k annual revenue
  - R: SKU introduction without forecast, seasonal misalignment, preference shifts
  - I: ₹44.1k carrying cost > ₹27.6k revenue = ₹16.5k annual loss
  - R: Tier 1 (>120d): 30% discount/donate; Tier 2 (90-120d): 15% discount

**Finding 6: Price Variance & Revenue Leakage**
- Chart: Figure 6.4.1 (Bar chart: top 20 misaligned SKUs by price CV %)
- ORIR structure:
  - O: Top 20 SKUs show unit price CV 16.8% vs acceptable <5%
  - R: POS misconfiguration, variant mix, manual errors, billing glitches
  - I: ₹512k annual revenue leakage (18% variance × 50% downward error assumption)
  - R: POS consolidation, pricing matrix by size, staff training for 99% consistency

## ✅ QUALITY GATE: 10-POINT VERIFICATION

Before you submit Section 6, run this checklist:

**Content Quality:**
1. ✅ ORIR completeness—Every finding has explicit Observation, Reason, Implication, Recommendation
2. ✅ Quantified evidence—95%+ of claims backed by numbers (no "high", "significant", "some")
3. ✅ Business implication—Every finding quantifies ₹ at stake or opportunity size
4. ✅ Actionable recommendation—Every recommendation includes phase, timeline, responsible party, success metric

**Visual & Data:**
5. ✅ Chart integration—Each finding has 1 supporting chart (Figure 6.X.X) with caption
6. ✅ Data traceability—Every statistic linked to source CSV file
7. ✅ Problem mapping—Each finding explicitly addresses ≥1 of 4 problem objectives

**Professional Standards:**
8. ✅ Tone & language—100% third-person professional, zero "I/we", passive voice where appropriate
9. ✅ Word count—Total 2,400-2,900 words, balanced across 6 findings
10. ✅ Formatting—Times New Roman 12pt, 1.5 spacing, justified alignment, page numbers

## 🎯 YOUR MISSION FOR SECTION 6

**Goal:** 2,400-2,900 words, 6-8 findings, 10/10 marks

**Method:** ORIR Framework + Quantified Evidence + Business Linking

**Timeline:** 5 days (2 hours/day planning + execution)

- 6 recommendations phased across timeline (immediate to long-term)
- 100% problem objective coverage (all 4 problem objectives addressed)
- Elite execution (9-10/10 marks achievable)

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL REMINDERS

**DO:**
✅ Use ORIR for EVERY finding (no exceptions)  
✅ Quantify EVERY claim (percentage, ₹ amount, count, statistic)  
✅ Extract all numbers from CSV files (not estimates or industry averages)  
✅ Link recommendations to problem objectives  
✅ Time-bound all actions (Week 1-2, Month 1-3, etc.)

**DON'T:**
❌ Write finding without Reason (Why is this happening?)  
❌ Present numbers without interpretation  
❌ Include charts without text explanation  
❌ Recommend without timeline or metric  
❌ Use first-person language ("We found", "I believe")
