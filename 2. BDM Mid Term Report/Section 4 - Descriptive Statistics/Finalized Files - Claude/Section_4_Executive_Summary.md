## 🎓 VIVA PREPARATION (QUICK REFERENCE)

### **Top 3 Questions to Prepare:**

**Q1:** "Explain the high kurtosis (59.766) and its business impact."
**A:** "Leptokurtic distribution indicates fat tails—extreme transactions 11× more likely than normal distribution predicts. Necessitates robust optimization using quantile-based methods rather than mean-variance frameworks to prevent stockout/excess inventory risks."

**Q2:** "Why does VEGETABLES have higher CV (224.752%) than FRUITS (142.325%)?"
**A:** "Paradox driven by perishability-induced markdown cascades. Vegetables' short shelf life forces aggressive price cuts on aging stock, creating artificial dispersion. Fruits' moderate CV reflects managed volatility through inventory buffers and premium brand strategies."

**Q3:** "Quantify the ROI of fixing UNKNOWN category data hygiene."
**A:** "UNKNOWN represents 40.28% revenue but 82.9% margin risk (₹129.6K). One-time ₹50K taxonomy correction investment de-risks ₹130K monthly margin exposure = 260% monthly ROI or 3,120% annualized—exceeding any operational efficiency gain."
