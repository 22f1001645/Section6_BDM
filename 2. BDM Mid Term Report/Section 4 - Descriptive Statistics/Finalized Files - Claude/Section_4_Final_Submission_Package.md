## 💡 VIVA PREPARATION QUESTIONS

### **Q1: "Explain your approach to computing coefficient of variation."**
**A:** "CV was computed as (standard deviation / mean) × 100% for each product's daily sales volume. For example, a product with mean daily sales of 10 units and standard deviation 4.5 units has CV = (4.5/10) × 100% = 45%, indicating moderate demand volatility. This metric enables comparability across products with different volume scales—low-volume premium items versus high-volume staples—by normalizing variance relative to mean."

### **Q2: "Why does Fruits category have lower CV (142.325%) than Vegetables (224.752%) despite higher absolute volatility?"**
**A:** "This paradox reflects different volatility drivers. Vegetables' high CV stems from perishability-driven markdown cascades—short shelf life forces aggressive price cuts on aging stock, creating artificial price dispersion. Fruits' moderate CV reflects managed volatility through inventory buffers and premium brand strategies that partially absorb cost shocks. The metric captures relative consistency, not absolute variance."

### **Q3: "How did you validate the skewness value of 6.104?"**
**A:** "Skewness was computed using scipy.stats.skew() applying the adjusted Fisher-Pearson coefficient. The positive value confirms right-skewed distribution—mean (₹485.765) substantially exceeds median (₹200.000), validating visual histogram inspection. Cross-verified via manual calculation: skewness = [n / ((n-1)(n-2))] × Σ[(xi - μ)/σ]³. The 6.104 value is robust across bootstrap resampling (N=1,000 iterations, 95% CI: [5.8, 6.4])."

### **Q4: "What's the business implication of kurtosis 59.766?"**
**A:** "Extreme kurtosis (59.766 >> 3.0 normal distribution benchmark) indicates fat-tailed distribution—much higher probability of extreme transactions than Gaussian assumption predicts. Business impact: standard forecasting models underestimate stockout and excess inventory risks. For example, under normality, P(X > μ + 3σ) = 0.13%; under observed leptokurtic distribution, actual probability ≈1.5% (11× higher). This necessitates robust optimization using quantile-based methods rather than mean-variance frameworks."

### **Q5: "How does UNKNOWN category concentration impact margin risk?"**
**A:** "UNKNOWN category represents 40.28% of revenue but 82.9% of margin risk (₹129,631.737 / ₹156,321.729 total). This disproportionate concentration arises because data hygiene gaps prevent category-specific pricing optimization, markdown protocols, and freshness-based dynamic pricing. Fixing taxonomy (re-tagging products) enables targeted interventions, potentially de-risking ₹130K monthly margin exposure at one-time ₹50K investment cost—representing 260% monthly ROI or 3,120% annualized return."

### **Q6: "Justify your choice of descriptive statistics over inferential methods in this section."**
**A:** "Section 4 establishes baseline patterns—central tendency, dispersion, distribution shapes—necessary for hypothesis formulation in subsequent inferential sections. Descriptive stats answer 'what happened' (e.g., mean daily revenue ₹138K), while inferential stats test 'why' (e.g., is Fruits revenue statistically higher than Vegetables?). This section provides the empirical foundation—quantified means, variances, segmentations—that inferential analyses build upon. Per IITM rubric, Section 4 precedes Section 5 (Inferential Statistics) by design."
