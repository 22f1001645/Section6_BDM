## How to Use (For Report Writing)

### Option A: Feed Entire Folder to Claude

"Write Section 5 (Analysis Methods) using this master folder as reference. Follow the MJA framework (Method → Justification → Business → Alternatives → Rationale). Embed figures from `3_VISUALS/` folder. Cite exact metrics from `1_DATA_SOURCES/DERIVED/` CSVs. Target: 3,000–3,500 words across 5.1–5.7 subsections."

### Option B: Use Folder for Manual Writing

1. Review `4_TEMPLATES_AND_GUIDES/Section_5_Checklist.md` for requirements
2. Open `1_DATA_SOURCES/DERIVED/` for evidence
3. Reference `3_VISUALS/` for figures
4. Cross-check `5_RELATED_SECTIONS/` for integration
