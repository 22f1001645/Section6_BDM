### **DAY 2-3: WRITE SUPPORT SECTIONS (5-6 hours)**

#### **Day 2 Morning: Section 5.1 (1 hour)**

**Task:** Write Overall Analytical Workflow

**Template Structure:**
```
"To derive actionable business insights from Pure'O Naturals' 
operational data, a systematic analytical approach was adopted 
combining [5 phases]:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Purpose: Understanding distributions, patterns, outliers
   - Scope: 6-month data (Apr-Sep 2025), 87 SKUs, ₹25.4M revenue

2. Descriptive Statistical Analysis
   - Purpose: Quantifying central tendencies, variability
   - Key metrics: Mean, median, std dev, CV, skewness

3. Inventory Optimization Analysis
   - Purpose: Identifying high-risk, underperforming products
   - Methods: ABC classification, volatility assessment, turnover analysis

4. Profitability & Margin Analysis
   - Purpose: Diagnosing low-margin product vulnerabilities
   - Methods: Contribution margin, margin-at-risk quantification

5. Strategic Synthesis & Recommendations
   - Purpose: Translating findings into SMART recommendations
   - Format: Problem → Evidence → Action → Success Metric"
```

**Output:** 250-300 words, 1-page section

---

#### **Day 2 Afternoon: Section 5.3 (1.5 hours)**

**Task:** Justify 3-4 Visualization Methods

**For EACH Chart Type (150-200 words per chart):**

**Chart 1: ABC Pareto Chart**
```
Purpose: Identify vital few high-revenue products from trivial many

Composition:
- X-axis: Products ranked by descending revenue (1-87)
- Y-axis (left): Bar chart, individual product revenue
- Y-axis (right): Cumulative revenue percentage line
- Annotations: Vertical threshold lines at 68% (Class A/B) and 82% (Class B/C)

Why Elite: Dual-axis design communicates two dimensions simultaneously:
(1) Absolute magnitude (bar height shows individual product revenue) 
(2) Cumulative importance (cumulative line shows revenue concentration)

Pareto line crossing 80% threshold visually anchors the 80-20 principle, 
enabling instant recognition: "Top 12 products (18% of portfolio) 
generate 68% of revenue."

Business Value: Stakeholders immediately see revenue concentration pattern 
and prioritize resources accordingly. Class A receives daily review, 
Class C receives monthly review or discontinuation evaluation.
```

**Chart 2-4:** [Follow same structure for Volatility-Volume Matrix, Slow-Movers Alert, Category-Margin Heatmap]

**Output:** 400-500 words, 1-2 pages

---

#### **Day 2 Evening: Section 5.4 + 5.5 (2 hours)**

**Section 5.4: Tools & Software (200-250 words)**
```
Primary Analysis Platform:

Microsoft Excel (Data Manipulation & Descriptive Statistics)
- Pivot tables for category-wise aggregation
- Data Analysis Toolpak for descriptive statistics 
  (mean, median, std dev, skewness, kurtosis)
- Conditional formatting for visual pattern detection

Justification: Excel chosen for preliminary exploration and 
stakeholder communication. Pivot tables enable rapid multi-dimensional 
analysis without coding. Conditional formatting provides intuitive 
pattern visualization. Ubiquitous in retail operations; ensures 
business users can independently verify and extend analysis.

Python 3.x (Advanced Analysis & Visualization)
- pandas: Data loading, cleaning, grouping, aggregation; 
  multi-dimensional pivot operations
- numpy: Numerical computations; array operations for efficiency
- scipy.stats: Statistical testing, distribution functions
- matplotlib & seaborn: Publication-quality visualization, 
  Pareto charts, heatmaps

Justification: Python selected for reproducibility, advanced 
visualization, analytical rigor. Jupyter notebooks provide documented 
analytical workflow (linking code, results, interpretation in single file). 
pandas efficiently handles 6+ months transaction data (6000+ rows). 
seaborn produces publication-quality charts suitable for final reports.

Integration Rationale: Excel for stakeholder communication (operations teams); 
Python for methodological rigor (academic evaluation). Dual-tool approach 
balances accessibility with analytical transparency.
```

**Section 5.5: Limitations & Validation (350-400 words)**
```
Data Quality Assumptions:

1. Price Consistency Assumption: Unit prices assumed constant within 
product-day (i.e., all units of "A2 Buffalo Milk 500ml" sold on 
April 5, 2025, at identical unit price). In reality, mid-day promotions 
may cause variation; impact mitigated by using daily average price rather 
than transaction-level outliers.

2. Cost Proxy Accuracy: Contribution margin estimated using average unit 
price as cost proxy. Without actual COGS data, margin estimates are 
directional, not exact. Mitigation: Sensitivity analysis testing margin 
conclusions if COGS varies ±20% from proxy.

3. Temporal Data Completeness: Analysis assumes POS system captured all 
transactions consistently across 6-month period. If intermittent gaps exist 
(system downtime, manual off-system sales), revenue and volatility statistics 
are understated. Validation: Sample weeks cross-referenced with physical 
cash reconciliation reports (no discrepancies identified).

Analytical Limitations:

1. ABC Threshold Arbitrariness: Pareto thresholds (68%, 82%) based on 
historical retail benchmarks, not data-driven optimization. Future 
refinement: K-means clustering on revenue data to identify natural 
breakpoints vs. arbitrary percentiles.

2. Safety Stock Formula Simplification: Volatility-volume matrix uses CV 
as sole variability metric; ignores lead time variability and service level 
targets. Future enhancement: Service level-based safety stock formula 
(e.g., "Target 95% fill rate → safety stock = Z-score × σ × √lead time").

3. Seasonality Decomposition Incomplete: Rolling volatility captures seasonal 
patterns but does not explicitly decompose trend vs. seasonality vs. random 
noise. Future advancement: Seasonal decomposition (LOESS/STL) to isolate 
structural seasonality from transient volatility.

4. Missing Profit Margin Data: Analysis relies on revenue-based proxies for 
margin; direct cost data absent. Recommendation: Implement cost tracking in 
POS system to enable precise margin analysis in final report.

Rigor Checkpoints:
✓ Normality Tests: Distribution characteristics (skewness, kurtosis) reported; 
non-normal distributions flagged requiring non-parametric interpretation.
✓ Outlier Validation: CV, range, and IQR computed; transactions exceeding 
3σ flagged for manual verification (no systematic removal to preserve integrity).
✓ Dimensionality Considerations: Bivariate analysis (CV vs. Volume) reduces 
dimensionality vs. multivariate complexity, balancing analytical depth with 
interpretability.
✓ Cross-Validation: Findings from one method (e.g., ABC Classification) 
triangulated with alternative methods (e.g., Volatility-Volume Matrix) to 
ensure robustness.
```

**Output:** 600+ words across Sections 5.4 & 5.5

```

**Section 5.7: Implementation Roadmap (250-300 words)**
```
Phase 1: Immediate Implementation (0-2 weeks)

- Task 1: Finalize ABC classification thresholds (68%, 82%) and publish 
  Class A/B/C assignment to operations team
- Task 2: Compute safety stock formulas per quadrant 
  (Q1: 40% buffer, Q2: 10%, Q3: 5%, Q4: 50% + review)
- Task 3: Identify top 10 slow movers (DSLS > 90 days) and initiate 
  clearance protocol (20-30% discount promotion)

Phase 2: Routine Monitoring (Weeks 2-8)

- Weekly: Track actual vs. forecast safety stock adequacy; monitor 
  stockout frequency by category
- Bi-weekly: Review margin performance by product; flag pricing 
  anomalies exceeding 15% CV threshold
- Monthly: Re-compute ABC classification (products may shift between classes); 
  update volatility estimates

Phase 3: Strategic Optimization (Weeks 8-12)

- Quarterly: ABC rebalancing based on 3-month rolling revenue
- Dynamic Pricing Pilots: Test price increases on low-margin Class A staples 
  (target: 15% margin improvement)
- SKU Rationalization: Finalize discontinuation decisions for Q4 products 
  (>90 days DSLS, <₹500 quarterly revenue)

Success Metrics:

| Metric | Baseline | Target | Monitoring |
|--------|----------|--------|------------|
| Revenue CV | 47% | <40% (25% improvement) | Monthly |
| Class A Stockout Rate | Unknown | <2% | Weekly |
| Low-Margin Products | 48% of SKUs | <35% of SKUs | Monthly |
| Slow-Mover Inventory Value | ₹[X] | <₹[X/2] | Quarterly |
| Price Consistency (Avg CV) | 18% | <12% | Monthly |
```
