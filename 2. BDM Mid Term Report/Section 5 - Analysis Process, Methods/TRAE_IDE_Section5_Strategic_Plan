---

#### **STAGE 2: PLANNING PHASE (Structure & Sequence)**

TRAE IDE PRO should:

1. **Confirm Section 5 Structure:**
   - 5.1: Overall Workflow (250-300 words) → Use Mastery Guide template
   - 5.2: Method Justifications (2,450+ words) → MJA framework, 7 methods
   - 5.3: Visualization Justifications (400-500 words) → 3-4 chart types
   - 5.4: Tools & Software (200-250 words) → Excel + Python
   - 5.5: Limitations (350-400 words) → Data assumptions, simplifications
   - 5.6: Rubric Alignment (200-250 words) → Explicit mapping to 25 marks
   - 5.7: Implementation Roadmap (250-300 words) → Phases + metrics

2. **Map Existing Assets to Sections:**
   - Section 5.2, Method 1 ← `high_volatility_products.csv` (CV calculation)
   - Section 5.2, Method 2 ← `rolling_volatility.csv` (time-series pattern)
   - Section 5.2, Method 3 ← `abc_classification.csv` (Pareto 68%, 82%)
   - Section 5.2, Method 4 ← `low_margin.csv` (20% margin floor)
   - Section 5.2, Method 6 ← `slow_moving_products.csv` (DSLS > 90 days)
   - Section 5.2, Method 7 ← `pricing_misalignment_top20.csv` (price variance)

3. **Identify Visualization Anchors:**
   - Pareto Chart (ABC Classification, Figure 5.X.X)
   - Volatility-Volume Risk Matrix (Bivariate risk, Figure 5.X.X)
   - Category-wise Margin Heatmap (Month x Category, Figure 5.X.X)
   - Rolling Volatility Trend (Time-series pattern, Figure 5.X.X)

4. **Create Content Outline (Subtask by Subtask):**
   - 5.1.1: Define 5-phase analytical progression
   - 5.2.1: CV Analysis → Method name, stats justify, business justify, alternatives, rationale
   - 5.2.2: Rolling Volatility → Same structure
   - [Repeat for all 7 methods]
   - 5.3.1: Pareto Chart → Purpose, composition, why elite, business value
   - [Repeat for each visualization]

---

#### **STAGE 3: CONTENT GENERATION PHASE (Write)**

TRAE IDE PRO should:

1. **Generate Section 5.1 (Overall Workflow):**
   - Template: Mastery Guide Section 5.1
   - Input: 5-phase progression (EDA, Stats, Optimization, Profitability, Synthesis)
   - Output: 250-300 words, professional tone, third-person

2. **Generate Section 5.2 (Method Justifications — PRIORITY):**
   - For EACH of 7 methods:
     - **Method Name:** Explicit, descriptive (e.g., "Coefficient of Variation Analysis — Revenue Demand Fluctuation Assessment")
     - **Method Description:** 1-2 paragraphs, define formula, state data analyzed, output produced
     - **Statistical Justification:** 2-3 paragraphs, distribution assumptions, parametric/non-parametric choice, why appropriate
     - **Business Justification:** 2-3 paragraphs, operational problem, quantified impact, Pure'O Naturals specific
     - **Alternative Methods Considered:** 3+ alternatives with specific limitations
     - **Chosen Rationale:** 1-2 sentences synthesizing technical + operational advantages
   - Data to incorporate from CSVs:
     - CV: "CV 47% overall branch, high-volatility SKUs CV > 50%"
     - Rolling Volatility: "30-day window captures seasonal shifts; June peak 52% volatility vs. stable 28%"
     - ABC: "Class A 12 SKUs, 68% revenue; Class B 14 SKUs, 14%; Class C 51 SKUs, 18%"
     - Margin: "42 of 87 SKUs <15% margin, monthly loss ₹373,727; target 20% floor"
     - Volatility-Volume: "Quadrant strategy Q1 (high vol, high qty) → 40% safety stock; Q4 (high vol, low qty) → discontinuation review"
     - DSLS: "23 SKUs DSLS > 90 days, ₹176,489 aging inventory; negative ROI"
     - Price Variance: "Top 20 misaligned SKUs CV > 15%, ₹248,358 revenue impact; revenue leakage"

3. **Generate Section 5.3 (Visualization Justifications):**
   - Chart Type 1: Pareto (ABC Classification)
     - Purpose: Identify vital few from trivial many
     - Composition: X-axis products ranked, left Y-axis bar revenue, right Y-axis cumulative line
     - Why Elite: Dual-axis communicates two dimensions, Pareto line anchors 80-20 principle
     - Business Value: Instant prioritization "Top 12 products → 68% revenue"
   - [Repeat for 3-4 additional charts]

4. **Generate Section 5.4 (Tools & Software):**
   - Excel: Pivot Tables (category aggregation), Data Analysis Toolpak (descriptive stats), conditional formatting
   - Python: pandas (aggregation), numpy (computation), scipy.stats (testing), seaborn (visualization)
   - Justification: Excel for stakeholder accessibility, Python for rigor + reproducibility

5. **Generate Section 5.5 (Limitations & Validation):**
   - Data Quality Assumptions: Price consistency, cost proxy accuracy, temporal completeness
   - Analytical Limitations: ABC thresholds arbitrary (68%, 82%), safety stock formula simplified, seasonality not decomposed
   - Rigor Checkpoints: Normality testing, outlier validation, dimensionality balance, cross-validation

6. **Generate Section 5.6 (Rubric Alignment):**
   - Explicit mapping: Method Clarity (5 marks) → every method explicitly named
   - Statistical Justification (7 marks) → distribution assumptions + formulas + interpretation
   - Business Justification (7 marks) → problem → impact → decision
   - Alternative Comparison (4 marks) → "Considered X, chose Y because..."
   - Limitations Acknowledged (2 marks) → data assumptions, simplifications

7. **Generate Section 5.7 (Implementation Roadmap):**
   - Phase 1 (0-2 weeks): Finalize ABC, compute safety stock, identify slow movers
   - Phase 2 (2-8 weeks): Weekly stockout monitoring, bi-weekly margin review, monthly ABC rebalancing
   - Phase 3 (8-12 weeks): Dynamic pricing pilots, SKU rationalization decisions
   - Success Metrics: Revenue CV baseline 47% → target <40%; stockout rate → <2%; low-margin products → <35% of portfolio

---

#### **STAGE 4: VERIFICATION PHASE (Quality Gate)**

TRAE IDE PRO should:

1. **Apply 10-Point Excellence Checklist (from Mastery Guide):**
   - [ ] All methods explicitly named
   - [ ] Statistical justification for each
   - [ ] Business justification for each
   - [ ] Alternatives compared for each
   - [ ] Limitations acknowledged
   - [ ] Visualization methods justified

   - [ ] Rubric alignment stated
   - [ ] Third-person professional tone
   - [ ] Word count verification (2,500-2,700 total, 350-400 per method)

2. **Run MJA Framework Verification:**
   - For EACH method, confirm: Method Name ✓ → Statistical Justification ✓ → Business Justification ✓ → Alternatives ✓ → Rationale ✓

3. **Check Tone Compliance:**
   - Search for "I", "we", "I think" (should be zero)
   - Verify third-person professional language throughout
   - Confirm quantified statements (no vague "high volatility" without CV%)

4. **Final Assembly:**
   - Confirm Section 5.1-5.7 sequential flow
   - Verify figure references (all mentioned charts exist)
   - Check formatting: Times New Roman 12pt, 1.5 spacing, justified
   - No orphaned paragraphs

## PART 5: CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS FOR TRAE IDE PRO

### **DO's — Execute These**

✅ **DO: Leverage Existing CSV Outputs**
- All 7 methods have computation outputs already
- Extract statistics directly from CSVs (don't recalculate)
- Use numbers with confidence ("770 SKUs with CV > 25%" comes directly from data)

✅ **DO: Apply MJA Framework Religiously**
- Every method must have 5-component structure (no shortcuts)
- Use Mastery Guide templates as starting framework
- Adapt to Pure'O Naturals specifics (not copy-paste)

✅ **DO: Quantify Everything**
- Never state "high volatility" without CV %
- Never state "low margins" without margin %, count, and ₹ impact
- Every claim backed by number from CSVs

✅ **DO: Prioritize Section 5.2 (Method Justifications)**
- This is the 25-mark core
- 2,450+ words of dense, rigorously-justified analysis
- Spend 60% of writing effort here

✅ **DO: Use Rubric as North Star**
- Every mark allocation explicit
- Every section designed to address specific rubric criterion
- Final checklist verifies all 25 marks addressed

---

### **DON'Ts — Avoid These**

❌ **DON'T: Generate Synthetic Analysis**
- Don't invent new methods or calculations
- Don't fabricate statistics
- Don't create synthetic data visualizations
- USE EXISTING CSV OUTPUTS exclusively

❌ **DON'T: Treat Section 5 as Generic Methodology**
- Section 5 is PURE'O NATURALS specific
- Link every method to revenue volatility, margin pressure, inventory problems
- Use actual numbers from CSV data (not retail industry averages)

❌ **DON'T: Use First-Person Narrative**
- "I analyzed," "we used" → WRONG
- "Analysis employed," "Methods selected" → CORRECT
- Maintain third-person professional throughout

❌ **DON'T: Shortcut Justifications**
- "We used ABC classification" → INSUFFICIENT
- "ABC classification chosen over alternatives because..." → REQUIRED
- Every method must explain WHY vs. alternatives

❌ **DON'T: Include Charts Without Interpretation**
- Never embed chart alone
- Always follow with ORIR paragraph (Observation, Reason, Implication, Recommendation)
- Quantify insights (not "high revenue" but "₹1.3M from 2 SKUs, 13% of total")
