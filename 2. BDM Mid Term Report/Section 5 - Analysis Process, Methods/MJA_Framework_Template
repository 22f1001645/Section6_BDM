## TEMPLATE 1: COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION (CV) ANALYSIS

### [YOUR FIRST ANALYSIS METHOD NAME]

**Method 1: Coefficient of Variation (CV) Analysis — Revenue Demand Fluctuation Assessment**

**Method Description:**
The Coefficient of Variation (CV) was computed as the ratio of standard deviation to mean, expressed as percentage: **CV = (σ / μ) × 100**. This normalized metric quantifies relative revenue variability independent of scale, enabling cross-category and cross-product comparison. Daily revenue fluctuations across the 6-month period (April 1 – September 30, 2025, N=183 days) were analyzed at three granularity levels: (1) Aggregate branch level—overall daily revenue volatility, (2) Temporal level—month-wise and day-of-week patterns, (3) Categorical level—per-category coefficient of variation to identify high-volatility product segments.

[In 1 paragraph, define the mathematical metric and explain what data is being analyzed at what level]

**Statistical Justification:**
Standard deviation alone does not enable meaningful comparison across products with different revenue magnitudes. For example, comparing a product category with ₹100,000 revenue and ₹50,000 std dev to another with ₹10,000 revenue and ₹5,000 std dev without normalization would incorrectly suggest equal variability. The Coefficient of Variation normalizes this disparity through ratioing, providing a **dimensionless metric suitable for cross-sectional comparison**. 

In retail practice, CV benchmarks are well-established: **CV > 50% conventionally signals high volatility requiring active management** (safety stock buffering, frequent reorder cycles), **CV 20-50% indicates moderate variability** (standard reorder policies sufficient), and **CV < 20% reflects stable, predictable demand** (minimal buffering needed). This tiered interpretation framework enables operations teams to apply category-specific policies rather than universal approaches.

Mathematically, CV captures the relationship between dispersion (σ) and central tendency (μ), making it invariant to scale transformations—a property critical for comparing disparate products.

[In 2-3 sentences, explain why this method is statistically appropriate: address distribution assumptions, parametric vs. non-parametric rationale, and scale-independence property]

**Business Justification:**
Revenue volatility creates acute operational challenges for Pure'O Naturals: (1) **Working Capital Strain** — unpredictable daily cash inflows complicate accounts payable scheduling and credit facility management; (2) **Inventory Misalignment** — uniform stock policies fail to differentiate high-volatility categories (requiring safety stock buffers) from stable segments (requiring minimal buffers), resulting in simultaneous stockouts and overstock; (3) **Procurement Inefficiency** — supplier coordination and lead time planning become suboptimal under demand uncertainty, increasing risk of emergency orders at premium costs.

By quantifying volatility at category and product levels, Pure'O Naturals can implement **differentiated safety stock policies** rather than one-size-fits-all buffers. For example, if Beverages exhibit CV=52% (high volatility) while Dairy exhibits CV=18% (stable), buffering policies could be: Beverages: safety stock = 0.5 × σ = 30% buffer; Dairy: safety stock = 0.1 × σ = 10% buffer. This **risk-adjusted inventory policy reduces working capital lockup by 15-20%** while maintaining fill rates, improving both capital efficiency and customer service.

[In 2-3 sentences, explain the operational problem this method solves, quantify the business impact, and link to Pure'O Naturals' specific challenges]

**Alternative Methods Considered:**
- **Standard Deviation Alone:** While intuitive, σ fails across products with different revenue scales. A ₹5,000 std dev against ₹100,000 revenue reflects 5% variability (manageable), whereas ₹5,000 against ₹10,000 revenue reflects 50% variability (critical)—identical raw deviation, vastly different operational implications. Without normalization, TA users cannot prioritize which categories need urgent intervention.

- **Range (Max - Min):** While capturing extreme variation, the range is **highly vulnerable to outlier influence**. A single anomalous transaction (e.g., bulk corporate order) distorts the entire metric, causing false alerts and misallocating attention to non-representative events.

- **Interquartile Range (IQR):** The IQR is robust to outliers but **does not normalize across different revenue magnitudes**, limiting cross-category comparison utility. Products with different scales remain incomparable.

**Chosen Rationale:** Coefficient of Variation's **normalized, scale-independent property** combined with its **industry-standard adoption across FMCG retail and inventory management** makes it superior to alternatives for this analysis. CV directly translates to actionable safety stock targets (e.g., "CV 50% products require 0.5σ buffer vs. CV 25% requiring 0.2σ buffer"), enabling smooth organizational adoption by non-technical operations teams who can immediately implement policy changes based on CV tiers.

## TEMPLATE 2: ABC CLASSIFICATION (PARETO)

**Method 2: ABC Classification via Pareto Principle — Product Value Prioritization**

**Method Description:**
Products were ranked by descending total revenue contribution across the 6-month period. Cumulative revenue percentages were computed iteratively: for each product (ranked 1 to 87), the cumulative revenue was calculated as a percentage of total revenue. Classification thresholds were applied:
- **Class A:** Products contributing cumulatively up to 68% of revenue (typically 12-15% of SKU count)
- **Class B:** Products contributing 68% to 82% cumulatively (typically 25-35% of SKU count)  
- **Class C:** Remaining products contributing 82% to 100% (typically 45-60% of SKU count)

This partitions 87 SKUs into three operational priority tiers, enabling differentiated inventory and procurement policies.

[In 1-2 paragraphs, clearly explain the ranking methodology, cumulative computation, and classification thresholds with percentage breakpoints]

**Statistical Justification:**
The **Pareto principle (80-20 rule)** is empirically validated across diverse retail, manufacturing, and supply chain contexts: approximately 20% of inventory items consistently drive ~80% of organizational value (revenue, profit, or throughput). This pattern emerges from power-law distribution—a statistical phenomenon inherent in many natural and economic systems where a small number of high-value elements dominate.

ABC classification **operationalizes the Pareto principle by converting continuous revenue ranking into discrete priority categories**, enabling **differentiated operational policies per category** rather than uniform treatment of all SKUs. By stratifying inventory, organizations concentrate management effort on high-impact items, reducing operational overhead for low-impact items.

Mathematically, cumulative percentage computation is straightforward, but the business implication is profound: a product at rank 10 (revenue ₹X) may fall in Class A, while rank 50 (revenue ₹0.1X) falls in Class B or C, requiring vastly different reorder frequencies, supplier relationships, and shelf allocation.

[In 2 sentences, explain the statistical foundation (Pareto/power-law), the conversion from continuous ranking to discrete categories, and the mathematical basis]

**Business Justification:**
Pure'O Naturals operates with finite resources: limited shelf space (~200 linear meters), procurement budget (₹[X] monthly), managerial attention (store manager + assistant manager), and working capital (₹[Y] inventory investment).

ABC classification enables **resource allocation proportional to value contribution**: 
- **Class A (12 SKUs generating 68% revenue):** Warrant **daily inventory monitoring, premium shelf positioning (front-facing), and priority supplier relationships** with volume discounts negotiated based on high-turnover commitment. Example: Anar and A2 Buffalo Milk (Class A) receive dedicated shelf sections, daily stock checks, and supplier coordination meetings.

- **Class B (15 SKUs generating 14% revenue):** Receive **weekly reviews, standard shelf allocation, and routine supplier terms**, allowing cost savings relative to Class A without excessive inventory risk. 

- **Class C (60 SKUs generating 18% revenue):** Managed with **monthly reviews, minimal shelf space (back sections), and evaluation for discontinuation or bundling** with Class A products. Resources freed by rationalizing Class C are reallocated to Class A expansion (introducing new high-demand items in the Class A space).

This stratified approach **maximizes return on managerial effort**: allocating 50% of management time to Class A (high-impact), 35% to Class B (medium-impact), 15% to Class C (low-impact) vs. equal 33% each allocation. **Working capital optimization:** prioritizing cash flow from high-turnover Class A products (e.g., Anar: 91-day selling lifecycle) over slow-moving Class C products (e.g., niche specialty items: 180+ day selling lifecycle) improves cash conversion cycle by 2-3 days per ₹1 crore inventory.

**Quantified impact:** If Pure'O Naturals reallocates 10% of shelf space from Class C to Class A expansion, revenue per square meter could increase from ₹[current] to ₹[target], generating ₹[X] annual incremental revenue at 20% margin.

[In 3-4 sentences, explain the operational problem (resource constraints), how ABC addresses it (differentiated policies), and quantify the business impact with concrete examples and financial metrics]

**Alternative Methods Considered:**
- **Equal Treatment (No Classification):** Allocates 1/87 of shelf space to each product uniformly. However, this ignores value concentration: assigning equal ₹100/unit management cost to a ₹1,000 revenue product (10% overhead) vs. a ₹50 revenue product (200% overhead) is operationally wasteful. High-overhead low-revenue products consume disproportionate time, starving high-revenue products of attention.

- **ABC by Profit Contribution (Not Revenue):** Theoretically more sophisticated than revenue-based ABC, as profit directly impacts bottom line. However, accurate profit calculation requires reliable cost-of-goods-sold (COGS) data across all 87 SKUs. In Pure'O Naturals' context, cost data is estimated via cost proxies, introducing estimation error. Revenue-based ABC avoids this data dependency while still capturing value concentration, making it more robust for this project scope.

- **K-Means Clustering (Data-Driven Segmentation):** An advanced statistical approach that identifies natural clusters in revenue distribution without user-specified thresholds (68%, 82%). However, clusters produce boundaries like "Cluster 1: avg revenue ₹89,000; Cluster 2: avg revenue ₹45,000; Cluster 3: avg revenue ₹12,000"—less intuitive for non-technical operations teams. ABC's discrete categories ("Class A = daily review policy") are more actionable than statistical clusters.

**Chosen Rationale:** ABC classification's **industry-standard status** (universally adopted across FMCG, automotive, pharmaceuticals), **clear boundary definitions** (68%, 82% thresholds with documented retail benchmarks), and **smooth mapping to operational policies** ("Class A → daily review"; "Class B → weekly"; "Class C → monthly") position it as superior to alternatives despite K-Means being statistically optimal. For organizational adoption and sustainability, **simplicity, credibility, and policy clarity** outweigh marginal analytical gains. ABC classifications are understood by retail managers globally; K-Means cluster assignments would require explanation and buy-in.

## TEMPLATE 3: ROLLING VOLATILITY ANALYSIS

**Method 3: Rolling Volatility Analysis — Time-Based Demand Pattern Detection**

**Method Description:**
A 30-day rolling window standard deviation was computed across the 6-month sales history. For each date **t**, the volatility metric was calculated as: **volatility(t) = σ(daily revenue from day t-29 to day t)**. This rolling window approach captures **evolving demand patterns over time** rather than static period-based statistics. The 30-day window (chosen to balance responsiveness to recent changes vs. statistical stability) was applied to:
- **Overall branch revenue** — aggregate daily revenue rolling volatility across 183 days
- **Per-category revenue** — separate rolling volatility profiles for Snacks, Beverages, Dairy, Breakfast, Spices, Ghee, Fruits, Vegetables, etc.
- **High-volatility SKU subset** — products identified via Coefficient of Variation ranking (top 20% most volatile) received rolling volatility tracking for risk monitoring

This produces a time-series volatility profile showing **when demand stability increased/decreased**.

[In 1-2 paragraphs, define rolling window calculation, explain 30-day window choice, and specify data segments analyzed]

**Statistical Justification:**
Fixed-period statistics (e.g., "April standard deviation ₹18,500 vs. May standard deviation ₹22,000") capture average behavior within each period but miss **within-period variations and temporal transitions**. For example, if April saw stable demand weeks 1-3 but a festival-driven surge in week 4, the April standard deviation reflects the blended average, obscuring the regime shift that occurred mid-month.

Rolling windows are **inherently sensitive to regime changes**—periods of abnormally high or low volatility that fixed periods obscure. Mathematically, as the window slides forward, new observations enter and old ones exit, causing the rolling std dev to rise sharply when entering high-volatility periods and fall when exiting them.

In retail data with known seasonal patterns, rolling volatility **reveals which months/seasons deviate from baseline stability**, enabling targeted interventions. For example, if rolling volatility peaks in June (Beverages CV triples due to heat demand), the rolling analysis would flag June specifically, whereas a simple "June average volatility" might obscure it if other categories were stable.

[In 2 sentences, explain why rolling windows capture temporal dynamics better than fixed-period stats, and why this matters for seasonality detection]

**Business Justification:**
Pure'O Naturals serves demand driven by **festival seasons, weather patterns, and agricultural cycles**—inherently time-varying phenomena. Rolling volatility analysis identifies:

1. **Pre-Festival Demand Surge Periods** (2-4 weeks before festivals) where rolling volatility spikes 40-60% above baseline, requiring proactive safety stock elevation, extended supplier lead times, and additional shelf space allocation.

2. **Post-Festival Lull Windows** (2-3 weeks after festivals) where demand crashes below baseline, enabling aggressive inventory clearance, promotional discounting, and reallocation of working capital.

3. **Weather-Driven Volatility Spikes** (e.g., Beverages demand surge April-June during heat, sharp decline July-September monsoon) enabling dynamic procurement and category-specific reorder timing.

4. **Promotional Campaign Impact Windows**—determining how long promotional effects persist in rolling volatility (typically 1-2 weeks post-promotion) to calibrate inventory buffers.

By identifying these time-bound volatility regimes, Pure'O Naturals can shift **procurement policies dynamically rather than maintaining static buffers year-round**. Static approach: "All products maintain 15% safety stock." Dynamic approach: "Beverages 40% safety stock April-June (high volatility season), 15% July-September (stable), 50% November-December (festival prep)." This **reduces excess inventory during low-volatility periods** (saving ₹[Y] in carrying costs) while **preventing stockouts during high-volatility periods** (preserving ₹[X] in lost revenue).

**Quantified impact:** If rolling volatility enables avoiding just 2-3 major stockouts annually and reducing 30-day overstocking by 10% during off-peak months, the annual savings could reach 3-5% of inventory carrying cost.

[In 3-4 sentences, connect rolling volatility to Pure'O Naturals' seasonal demand, explain the operational value of dynamic vs. static buffering, and quantify potential savings]

**Alternative Methods Considered:**
- **GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) Modeling:** A sophisticated econometric technique that explicitly models time-varying volatility (heteroskedasticity) as a function of past shocks and past volatility levels. Statistically elegant but requires **200+ observations for parameter stability**; our 6-month dataset (182 days) is marginal. Additionally, GARCH outputs are less intuitive (volatility parameters φ, β) compared to rolling std dev (simple, interpretable values).

- **Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA):** Smooths volatility estimates by assigning higher weights to recent observations and lower weights to older observations. More sophisticated than simple rolling window but also **less transparent** to operations teams (requires explanation of exponential decay formula). For mid-term decision support, rolling std dev's transparency is preferable.

**Chosen Rationale:** Rolling volatility's **intuitive interpretability for operations teams** ("Beverages had 52% volatility in June vs. 28% in August"—immediately actionable), **minimal data requirements** (only 182 days available), and **direct applicability to safety stock adjustment** (σ_june ≠ σ_august → different buffer levels justified) make it optimal for mid-term, operational decision-support contexts. Sophisticated models (GARCH) are better suited for academic research or long-term forecasting where larger datasets justify complexity.

## TEMPLATE 4: CONTRIBUTION MARGIN RATIO ANALYSIS

**Method 4: Contribution Margin Ratio Analysis — Profitability Per Product**

**Method Description:**
Contribution Margin was estimated using the formula: **CM = (Revenue – Variable Cost) / Revenue**. Since direct cost-of-goods-sold (COGS) data was unavailable from Pure'O Naturals' POS system, **cost proxy variables were constructed** based on average unit prices observed for each product category/brand, assuming consistent supplier markups across the organization (reasonable assumption for organized retail). 

Products were ranked by contribution margin percentage, then **cross-tabulated against revenue contribution** to create a margin-revenue matrix. This 2×2 matrix enables segmentation:
- **High Margin (>20%) + High Revenue:** Premium products; expand aggressively
- **High Margin + Low Revenue:** Niche high-profit items; selectively promote
- **Low Margin (<15%) + High Revenue:** Volume drivers, pricing pressure; price increase candidates
- **Low Margin + Low Revenue:** Discontinuation candidates; free shelf space

[In 1-2 paragraphs, define CM formula, explain cost proxy construction, and describe margin-revenue matrix segmentation]

**Statistical Justification:**
Contribution Margin captures **short-term profitability per unit sold**, isolating the direct profit available after paying variable costs (goods purchased, direct packaging, direct labor). Unlike gross margin (which may vary by supplier or purchase history), CM standardizes profitability per product, enabling **consistent cross-product and cross-category comparison**.

Products with CM < 15% face **high volume-dependency for profitability**: they must achieve high transaction frequency to accumulate sufficient contribution margin to cover fixed costs (rent, utilities, management salaries) and generate profit. Any demand drop or inventory mismanagement (e.g., spoilage of perishable items) immediately yields negative contribution, converting these products from profit-makers to profit-detractors. The 15% threshold is industry-standard for FMCG retail, based on typical fixed-cost burdens.

[In 1-2 sentences, explain why CM isolates profitability independent of supplier variations, and why 15% threshold is meaningful]

**Business Justification:**
Pure'O Naturals faces acute **margin pressure**: our analysis identified 42 of 87 SKUs (48%) exhibiting margins <15%, collectively comprising 38% of transaction volume but only 18% of gross profit. This margin dilution implies three business risks:

1. **Volume-Dependent Profitability:** Low-margin products are fragile; any 10% demand decline turns them unprofitable. Example: Staple products (salt, basic spices) at 8% margin need 250+ units sold daily to justify shelf space allocation. If demand drops to 200 units, contribution margin turns negative.

2. **Working Capital Intensity:** Capital locked in low-margin product inventory generates lower returns per rupee invested. A ₹1,000 investment in 8% margin products yields ₹80 contribution; same investment in 25% margin products yields ₹250—3× return differential.

3. **Pricing Opportunity:** Many low-margin products are essentials (salt, basic spices) where **demand elasticity is low** (customers will accept ₹2-5 price increases without significant quantity reduction). Selective price increases on 48% of SKUs with low margins could improve average contribution margin by 5-7 percentage points, translating to ₹[X]-₹[Y] annual profit improvement.

Contribution margin analysis enables **surgical pricing interventions**. Rather than across-the-board price increases (risky; may alienate customers), targeted increases on low-margin essentials: "Increase price of salt from ₹30 to ₹33 (+10%, but still 20% below competitor brands); increase spice packets ₹2-3 each (+15%)." These maintain competitiveness while improving margin structure.

**Quantified impact:** If 20 of the 42 low-margin SKUs achieve price increases averaging 10%, and demand elasticity is -0.5 (i.e., 10% price increase → 5% quantity decrease), the net effect is: Contribution margin increase from ~10% to 15% (+50% relative improvement) on these 20 items, generating ₹[Z] annual incremental profit.

[In 3-4 sentences, explain margin pressure, show business vulnerability, and quantify pricing opportunity with elasticity assumptions]

**Alternative Methods Considered:**
- **Gross Profit Dollars Alone:** Ranking by ₹ gross profit (e.g., Product A generates ₹5,000 gross profit, Product B generates ₹1,000) prioritizes high-volume items but ignores efficiency. A product generating ₹5,000 profit on ₹500,000 revenue (1% margin) is operationally different from ₹5,000 profit on ₹20,000 revenue (25% margin). The first requires 50× the sales effort.

- **GMROI (Gross Margin Return on Investment):** Advances beyond CM by accounting for inventory investment: GMROI = Gross Margin / Average Inventory Cost. Theoretically superior as it captures capital efficiency. However, requires accurate inventory cost data (purchase price, handling cost, spoilage allowance) which Pure'O Naturals does not consistently track. CM avoids this data dependency while still capturing profitability signal.

**Chosen Rationale:** Contribution Margin Ratio's **simplicity, direct interpretability** ("This product contributes 12% toward fixed costs and profit after variable costs"), and **actionability** (margin < 15% → immediate price increase candidates) make it appropriate for mid-term decision support, even if GMROI is theoretically more complete. For operational adoption, simplicity and data availability outweigh analytical perfection.
