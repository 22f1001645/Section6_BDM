---

## DURING-WRITING PHASE: SECTION 5.5 (Limitations & Validation)

### 5.5 Checklist:

#### Data Quality Assumptions (list ≥3):
- [ ] **Assumption 1 (Price Consistency):** "Unit prices assumed constant within product-day. Mitigation: used daily average price."
- [ ] **Assumption 2 (Cost Proxy Accuracy):** "Margin estimated using average unit price as cost proxy; margin estimates directional, not exact. Sensitivity: conclusions hold if COGS varies ±20%."
- [ ] **Assumption 3 (Temporal Completeness):** "POS system captured all transactions consistently. Validation: sample weeks cross-referenced with cash reconciliation (no discrepancies)."

#### Analytical Limitations (list ≥4):
- [ ] **Limitation 1 (ABC Thresholds):** "Thresholds (68%, 82%) based on retail benchmarks, not data-driven. Future: K-means clustering for natural breakpoints."
- [ ] **Limitation 2 (Safety Stock):** "CV as sole variability metric ignores lead time variability. Future: Service level-based formula."
- [ ] **Limitation 3 (Seasonality):** "Rolling volatility captures patterns but doesn't decompose trend vs. seasonality vs. noise. Future: Seasonal decomposition."
- [ ] **Limitation 4 (Cost Data):** "Analysis relies on revenue-based proxies for margin. Recommendation: implement cost tracking in POS system."

#### Rigor Checkpoints (state each):
- [ ] ✓ **Normality Testing:** "Distribution characteristics (skewness, kurtosis) reported; non-normal distributions flagged"
- [ ] ✓ **Outlier Validation:** "Transactions exceeding 3σ flagged for verification (not removed to preserve data integrity)"
- [ ] ✓ **Dimensionality Balance:** "Bivariate analysis captures essential risk dimensions while maintaining interpretability"
- [ ] ✓ **Cross-Validation:** "Findings triangulated across methods (e.g., ABC validated against Volatility-Volume Matrix)"

**Total 5.5 Word Count Target: 350-400 words**

- [ ] Explicitly stated: "Method name (5 marks): Every method explicitly named... Statistical justification (7 marks): For each method, provided distribution assumptions and mathematical rationale..."
- [ ] Total mapping confirms all 25 marks addressed across Section 5

**Total 5.6 Word Count Target: 200-250 words**

---

## TONE & LANGUAGE GUARDRAILS

### Throughout Section 5, Verify:

✓ **Third-Person Professional:**
- [ ] NO "I analyzed" or "we considered" ← change to "Analysis employed" or "Methods selected"
- [ ] NO "I think" or "we believe" ← change to "Evidence suggests" or "Findings indicate"

✓ **Active Voice (Science Writing Standard):**
- [ ] Preferred: "Coefficient of Variation was computed to quantify..."
- [ ] Avoid: "We computed Coefficient of Variation..."

✓ **Quantified Statements:**
- [ ] Every assertion backed by number
- [ ] NO "High volatility" → YES "CV 47% indicates significant demand fluctuation"
- [ ] NO "Some products have low margins" → YES "42 of 87 SKUs (48%) exhibit margins <15%"

✓ **Academic-Professional Phrasing:**
- [ ] "This approach enables..." (vs. "This helps...")
- [ ] "Operationalize the principle..." (vs. "Use the principle...")
- [ ] "Statistically appropriate for..." (vs. "Better for...")
